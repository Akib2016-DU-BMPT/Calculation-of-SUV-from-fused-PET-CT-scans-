# Calculation-of-SUV-from-fused-PET-CT-scans-
the calculation of the SUVs of PET images by MATLAB software-based programming has taken on a major role and will come out as an alternate way of determining SUV values rather than the commercial-based software. Image quality has also been enhanced by reducing the gaussian noise, which can vary the intensity gradient of the PET-CT-derived images.
